    <h3>Problems</h3>
      <h4>Principle issue</h4>
        <p>Unless an admin interacts with a feature gate or user limit, there are currently no in-product indications that they’re on a Free plan, or that other plans exist.</p>
        <a href="img/current-signing-up.png"><img src="img/current-signing-up.png"></a>
        <p class="caption">In the sign-up process, there is a brief mention of the free plan on the second screen, but otherwise, a user could sign up with no idea that there are other plans.</p>
      <h4>Other problems</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>If the user did manage to start a trial, there were no trial status indications in the product.</li>
        <li>When inside the product, it takes 5 clicks to get to upgrade, and none of the CTAs say anything about upgrading.</li>
        <li>Nth users have no indication of an instance’s trial status or any benefits of the trial.</li>
      </ol>
      <a href="img/current-upgrade-flow.png"><img src="img/current-upgrade-flow.png"></a>
      <p class="caption">The path to upgrading takes 5 clicks through admin pages</p>
    
    <h3>Research</h3>
      <h4>User research</h4>
        <p>From the research conducted by the team previously working on Free (Redbull) and the Growth Research team, we saw that users typically became aware of the other plans when they hit a feature gate or user limit. Furthermore, the study Free User Onboarding Ecosystem Considerations found that “the decision-maker isn’t always the founding admin, so they hadn’t necessarily been through set-up and plan choice.” This leads to users not knowing the specifics of their plan, or what plan they're on.</p>
        <p>From this research, we also saw that the stated limits of the plans were often a detractor. For instance, when customers would see the 5,000 user limit on Standard, they felt this plan was not for them, because they only had 10-20 users.</p>
        <a href="img/user-limit.png"><img src="img/user-limit.png"></a>
        <p class="caption">Small teams see the 5,000 user limit as an indication that they’re not ready for a paid plan
        </p>
      <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
        <p>I analyzed the paths and UI patterns of many other companies in the tech space to see how they make users aware of paid plans, encourage them to upgrade, and communicate trial status. What I found was that while the user was not paying (in a trial or in a free plan) nearly every product had a persistent upgrade touchpoint in a highly visible place in the product. Once the account was upgraded, the touchpoint usually disappeared.</p>
        <a href="img/competitors-buttons.png"><img src="img/competitors-buttons.png"></a>
    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>We believe that helping people understand what edition they’re on and providing them with a clear and persistent touchpoint to upgrade will result in an increase in upgrades because users will be more aware of premium plans and have a smoother path to upgrade.</p>

    <h3>Metrics</h3>
      <h4>Usability requirements for success</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>People know what plan they’re on</li>
        <li>People have a clear path to upgrade (start a trial)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What we’re measuring</h4>
      <ul>
        <li># of upgrades via this new touch-point</li>
        <li># of upgrades overall</li>
        <li>PEU (Paid enabled users) and MAU (monthly active users)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Design</h3>
      <h4>Design principles</h4>
        <p>Adding a persistent reminder that users are on a free plan can easily become a negative experience, so I created some design principles to use as a guide for the solutions. They are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Visibile without disrupting:</strong> The touchpoint should drive user curiosity and behavior to evaluate the efficacy of upleveled features and limits without negatively impacting the core product experience. In varied states ands widths, the touchpoint should give way to other UI elements to mitigate noise, clutter, and conflicts.</li>
          <li><strong>Informative:</strong> The touchpoint should intelligently convey the state of a trial (before trial, in trial, and trial over) for both admins and nth users, and create a compelling E2E content narrative.</li>
          <li>Align with ADG & industry best practices: The touchpoint should conform both to the industry standards and ADG’s guidelines.</li>
        </ol>
      <h4>States and their jobs to be done</h4>
        <p>There are three main states that a trial can be in: Pre trial, during trial, and after trial. Each state has a different JTBD (job to be done).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>pre-trial</strong> phase’s purpose is to make users aware that they’re on the free plan, and show them the benefits of upgrading.</li>
          <li><strong>During the trial</strong>, the goal is to communicate the benefits of the plan they’re trialing, the end date of the trial, and how to pay.</li>
          <li>The <strong>dunning</strong> phase is 14 days after the trial has ended. The job of this phase is to clearly communicate the actions they can take and their respective consequences. If there are more than 10 users on the account and no payment, the account is eventually deactivated.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Process</h4>
        <p><strong>Going broad</strong></p>
          <p>Using the research and competitive analysis as a guide for our users’ expectations, I designed several options for persistently displaying the upgrade touchpoint in the product.</p>
          <a href="img/goingbroad.png"><img src="img/goingbroad.png"></a>
          <p class="caption">Exploring different placements for trial information</p>
          <p>In the beginning, our preference was to add the upgrade touchpoint to the main (top) navigation since this seems to be the most common location in other SAAS products. This was a challenging task because the navigation bars of our products are already very full, and I did not want the upgrade touchpoint to overshadow the core functionality. In my initial explorations, I paid particular attention to the navigation content in each product, and the width of the page.</p>
          <a href="img/touchpointoptions.png"><img src="img/touchpointoptions.png"></a>
          <p class="caption">Top navigation touchpoint options</p>
          <a href="img/widths-and-states.png"><img src="img/widths-and-states.png"></a>
          <p class="caption">Considerations for states and browser widths</p>
        <p><strong>Narrowing in</strong></p>
          <p>I went through several iterations of sparring with a representative from ADG (Tamarah Walsh), growth, and product teams. Through this process, it became clear to us that persisting the state of the trial in the navigation bar would be too much of an interruption to the core experience, and would not give us the space we wanted to convey all the information pertaining to the trial. Because of this, we decided to use the banner component instead.</p>
          <p>Banners can often be seen as a nuisance, and I did not want this banner to get in the way, so I made several modifications to it. Firstly, I made it dismissable, so the user could remove it when needed. Secondly, I decreased the height so that it would not take up as much space. This was important because there are pages in some products that already have a lot of vertical space above the core area of interaction. Thirdly, we changed the pattern so that the banner would only show up intermittently, and when necessary.</p>
          <a href="img/banner-mods.png"><img src="img/banner-mods.png"></a>
          <p class="caption">Full-width banner, but make it fashion</p>
          <p>Using this banner and the nudge component, we trained the user to access more information and actions in the account dropdown.</p>
          <a href="img/new-flow.png"><img src="img/new-flow.png"></a>
          <p>The banner treatment also allowed us to add important information specific to the state of the trial. In the pre-trial period we could tell the user why they might want to upgrade, during the trial we could show them new features and tell them their end date, and after the trial, we could show them timely information regarding their account.</p>
          <a href="img/banners.png"><img src="img/banners.png"></a>
          <p>Another key component of this flow is the user benefits modal. We decided to let the user upgrade through this modal flow so that they would not have to go into the Admin portal. This allowed us to focus on the benefits of upgrading instead of payment and plan details that they might not quickly understand.</p>
          <a href="img/user-benefits-modal.png"><img src="img/user-benefits-modal.png"></a>
          <p>The user benefits modal leads into the proactive billing flow which is a previous successful experiment.</p>
          <a href="img/trial-started-modal.png"><img src="img/trial-started-modal.png"></a>
      <!-- <h4>Final Designs</h4>
        <p>The final designs and flows for each project can be found in the Figma file linked below. One notable change between the products is the location of the banner. In Confluence, the banner component lives above the nav and in Jira products, it lives beneath it in the main pages. There are also considerations for users with multiple Jira products because they share the same navigation.</p> -->

    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>This experiment is currently in development. Unfortunately, the Nth user aspect of the project has been descoped for now, but we plan to run it as a follow-up experiment. We also plan to link it to our show plans experiment, which improves the proactive billing flow. </p>
