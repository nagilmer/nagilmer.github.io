    <h3>Summary</h3>
      <a href="img/ltc-redesign.png"><img src="img/ltc-redesign.png"></a>
      <p>This project was a complete redesign of the e-commerce platform for the Leelanau 
          Trading Co. </p>
      <p>The Leelanau Trading Co. is the company that my parents started in 1994. It is an 
          American-made company that manufactures hand made leather and wood bags, luggage and 
          journals, as well as provides customization for menus and corporate gifts. The products 
          have been featured in Urban Outfitters, Lands End, Starbucks, Cabelas, and many boutiques around 
          the world. </p>
    <h3>First Redesign</h3>
      <p>Most of the business for the Leelanau Trading Co. is currently wholesale, partly because the 
        previous website had not been updated since its creation (in the late 90’s), and not easy to 
        use. Customers often called to complain about how they couldn’t navigate the site and how 
        the pictures were out of date, and not all the products were available. It was also a bit 
        of an eye-sore with its outdated graphics, and tiny font. The products are so beautiful, 
        and made with so much care, it seemed unfair that they should have such an unattractive 
        home online. </p>
      <p>You can see for yourself what I mean:</p>
      <a href="img/LTC-old-site.png"><img src="img/LTC-old-site.png" alt="Original website"></a>    
      <p>I first created a WordPress e-commerce website with WooCommerce and the Avada theme to house 
        the products, installed necessary plugins, created the aesthetic of the site through the 
        options in the theme, created the graphics for the banners in Illustrator, edited the 
        product photos in Photoshop, and wrote the product descriptions. </p>
      <a href="img/LTC-First-Redesign.png"><img src="img/LTC-First-Redesign.png" alt="First redesign of 
        Leelanau Trading Co. Site"></a>
      <p>This definitely improved the overall look and usability of the site, and has been steadily 
        increasing online sales. However, I have found that there are still very “wonky” sections 
        to this website that make it very difficult to use, and are most likely inhibiting users 
        from having a great experience. For example on the product page, it’s not at all obvious 
        how the user is supposed to add this item to his or her cart (you have to chose a color 
        first). </p> 
      <a href="img/LTC-Add-To-Cart.png"><img src="img/LTC-Add-To-Cart.png" alt="Add to cart is missing"></a>
      <p>Also, in the checkout flow, it the “proceed to checkout” button is grey, not very noticeable, 
        and looks the same as the rest of the buttons...except for that big blue button that is not 
        the main call to action on the page. </p>
      <a href="img/LTC-Cart.png"><img src="img/LTC-Cart.png" alt="Checkout button is hard to find"></a>
    <h3>Second Redesign</h3>
      <p>As the manager of this website, I can tell that there are lots of improvements that can be 
        made not just from a UX/UI standpoint but also editing the code for improved SEO. An e-commerce 
        website needs to accurately display the brand, be found easily through searches, and make it as 
        simple as possible to purchase items. </p>
      <p>Because I was in-between projects, I began to redesign this site from scratch. I’m currently working 
        on the wireframes and UI, and will begin coding soon. I will be coding the website using PHP (which 
        is what I used for this portfolio site), and integrating it with Wordpress. </p>
      <p>I began by mapping out the options and card-sorting to create the organization and navigation of the 
        site. The website is not only for e-commerce, it must provide information for the wholesale side of 
        the business (which is currently the bulk of sales). This includes selling to other stores, corporate 
        gifts, and custom menus. I chose create two different menus for this reason. </p>
      <p>One menu--at the top of the page--would be for the site overall. It has information on the company, 
        corporate gifts, menus, and products. “Wholesale” is not directly stated because that business is 
        acquired in other ways. The secondary menu is all about the products -- listing the types (purses, 
        luggage, journals etc.) so that users could easily navigate as well as see at a glance what the website 
        offers. </p>
      <p>Similarly, I created a large section above the fold showing the products, with some text speaking to the 
        American-made, and homespun nature of the products, and the two smaller photos beneath it offer a short 
        description of the corporate gifts and menus. Beneath these banner photos are the products categorized 
        by type. I put the most popular classification of items in the top row. </p>
      <a href="img/LTC-HomePage-Mock.jpg"><img src="img/LTC-HomePage-Mock.jpg" alt="Second redesign mockup"></a>
      <p>Another consideration for this site is that it not only has to be usable and professional but also retain 
        a hand-made quality because the products are mainly sold in boutiques.  </p>
      <p>I’m currently working out the final “look” of the site, translating the wireframes to mockups (using 
        photoshop for both), and designing the mobile version of the site. </p>
