      <p>Keepsafe Browser was an app I designed for <a href="https://getkeepsafe.com/" target="blank">Keepsafe</a> starting in March of 2018 through September 2018. At this time Keepsafe was creating a suite of privacy apps that interact with each other to create a private ecosystem on your phone. The original app (Keepsafe Photo Vault) was an app for keeping photos private, and they had recently added a VPN product, and Unlisted - which allows the user to have a private phone number.</p>
      <p>The goal of Keepsafe Browser was to allow users to search the web privately, as well as save photos directly to Photo Vault.</p>
      <p>My role was as the lead designer on this project. I worked with two project managers, an Android engineer, and an iOS engineer. The majority of the team was located in Berlin, so I traveled there several times to work with them. </p>
    <h3>How do I test a privacy product?</h3>
      <p>Immediately I knew my biggest problem with this project was going to be getting user input. Firstly, we didn’t have an existing user base because this app did not yet exist, secondly because people naturally don’t want to talk about what they use a private browser for. </p>
      <p>I began by creating a survey about private browsing that would go out to Photo Vault users. This survey covered general demographics and private browsing behavior. The vast majority of users’ use cases are served by private tabs on Chrome or Safari, but some users were interested in a separate browser.</p> 

      <p>I then contacted the users who said they would be interested in a private browser, and scheduled phone interviews with them. In the phone interviews, I covered previous history with private browsing, what their motivations were, and what they would like to see in a browser from Keepsafe.</p> 

      <p>In addition to asking PhotoVault users, we also spoke to some acquaintances who told us they would be interested in talking about private browsing.</p>

      <p>These interviews created a dilemma for us:  All the people we spoke to were much more tech savvy and data-privacy focused than the average consumer. We chalked this up to the fact that anyone who wanted to talk to us about this issue was predisposed to be someone looking for this type of solution, and be more technically inclined. </p>   

    <h3>Who is this app for?</h3>
      <p>Our testing told us that our user was someone very technically savvy who had a high level or paranoia and knowledge about his or her data privacy, but was this the person we really wanted to design for?</p> 

      <p>Doing research for this product, we realized there are really two kinds of privacy: One is data privacy - keeping your search habits away from advertisers. The other is physical privacy - keeping your search history away from your family and friends who can either see your phone or your search history.</p> 
 
      <p>We deliberated back and forth on whether we wanted to focus on the data privacy user or physical privacy users. Unlike the data-privacy users, the physical privacy people might like to keep their history and cookies stored for the next time they use the app. This type of person would be more interested in a regular browser with a PIN code and other privacy features that Keepsafe used in PhotoVault. We knew this user type existed because they are the types of people who use PhotoVault, but we had not actually heard from them related to private browsing.</p>
    <h3>Decisions</h3>
      <p>We decided to create an app that was “like PhotoVault” but for browsing, and cater to the physical privacy user, while still having some data privacy features like being able to block trackers and surf without history. These features allow the user to feel more comfortable with the app knowing that their searches are truly private. It also provides “plausible deniability” in case anyone asks why they have a private browser.</p> 

      <p>The app includes an optional PIN screen to keep anyone who knows your phone PIN out of the app. From testing, we heard a lot of people expressing concern about their children looking at other apps if they let them use their phones momentarily. </p>

      <p>The app allows users to search in both regular and private mode. Both modes are more secure than other browsers in terms of data privacy, but the private mode does not save your searches to autocomplete, or keep users logged in. </p>

      <p class="caption">Toggling between regular and private mode</p>

      <p>Users also have the option to “hide” secret tabs after 30 seconds of inactivity. This means that if they open up the app around people their last embarrassing search won’t be front and center. The tabs are still findable in the tabs screen.</p> 

      <p>It also provides a bit of extra information about the privacy of websites to curious users.</p>

      <p class="caption">Users can see how many trackers have been blocked</p>

      <p>We also created a built-in VPN for the app. This would give users privacy on their wireless networks, and allow them to bypass some firewalls.</p>

    <h3>Sprucing it up</h3>
        <p>One big component of this app was making it attractive and fun to use. There are a lot of private browsers out there, and it is a fairly simple app. We wanted to differentiate ourselves with UX and our playful brand voice.</p> 

        <p>I created a logo that would interact with the PIN screen to make it feel like the unlocking of a vault. </p>

        <p class="caption">The PIN screen opening</p>

        <p>I played with this unlocking circular concept in other places in the app as well.</p>

        <p class="caption">The animation for a broken connection to the VPN</p>

    <h3>How are people using the app?</h3>
        <p>The problem with the app being truly private is that we did not track what the users did at all, so after launching, I had to come up with a way to find this data. </p>

        <p>I had learned from the previous round of testing that the best way to get honest answers from people who to make the testing as impersonal as possible. I carefully crafted a survey that would be able to tell us as much as possible.</p> 

        <p>The survey gave us an excellent idea of how people were using the app, and our users were wonderfully honest. Unsurprisingly, the users were using it mainly as a second app to search their more private things. </p>

        <p>Some of the users from the survey agreed to speak to me on the phone. I used this opportunity to get more specific insights into how these were using the app, and what made them use it over other products.</p> 

        <p>I will not share too many specifics here because I value my users’ privacy, but we found that the app allowed our users to separate parts of their life that they were actively engaged with, but keeping hidden from certain friends of family. It was very inspiring to see how our product was helping people be themselves.</p> 
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I’m very happy with the app that we created. It was difficult to decide what to focus on and the scope because of the private nature of the app, but in the end we created a delightful app that is well-liked by users!</p>
